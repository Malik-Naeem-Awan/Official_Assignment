#Write Python Program to Check Whether a Number is Positive or Negative 
#1. Take the value of the integer and store in a variable. 
#2. Use an if statement to determine whether the number is positive or negative. 
#3. Exit.

#Write Python Program to Print all Integers that Arenâ€™t Divisible by Either 2 or 3 and Lie between 1 and 50. 
#1. Use a for-loop ranging from 0 to 51. 
#2. Then use an if statement to check if the number isnâ€™t divisible by both 2 and 3. 
#3. Print the numbers satisfying the condition. 
#4. Exit


# In[30]:

#Write Python Program to Exchange the Values of Two Numbers Without Using a Temporary Variable 
#Problem Solution 
#1. Take the values of both the elements from the user. 
#2. Store the values in separate variables. 
#3. Add both the variables and store it in the first variable. 
#4. Subtract the second variable from the first and store it in the second variable. 
#5. Then, subtract the first variable from the second variable and store it in the first variable. 
#6. Print the swapped values. 
#7. Exit


# In[35]:

#Write Python Program to Find the Area of a Triangle Given All Three Sides 
#Problem Solution 
#1. Take in all the three sides of the triangle and store it in three separate variables. 
#2. Then using the Heronâ€™s formula, compute the area of the triangle. 
#3. Print the area of the triangle.

#Write Python Program to Print Largest Even and Largest Odd Number in a List 
#1. Take in the number of elements to be in the list from the user. 
#2. Take in the elements from the user using a for loop and append to a list. 
#3. Using a for loop, get the elements one by one from the list and check if it odd or even and append them
#to different lists. 
#4. Sort both the lists individually and get the length of each list.

#Write Python Program to Find the Union of two Lists 
#1. Define a function which accepts two lists and returns the union of them. 
#2. Declare two empty lists and initialise to an empty list. 
#3. Consider a for loop to accept values for two lists.
#4. Take the number of elements in the list and store it in a variable.
#5. Accept the values into the list using another for loop and insert into the list.
#6. Repeat 4 and 5 for the second list also. 
#7. Find the union of the two lists. 
#8. Print the union.
